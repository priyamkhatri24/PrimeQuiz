# PrimeQuiz

This is a Quiz Project having four genres. The project is made based on Model-View-Controller architecture.
I have used Parcel bundler for this project.

I have focused on writing the code dynamically so that just by adding new questions to model data, the questions will automatically get added in the quiz flow without doing any changes in the code elsewhere.

To use the code base: 
1. first run <b>npm install<b/> ///// This will install the node_modules to your folder.
2. then to open the project on live server run: <b>npm start<b/>
